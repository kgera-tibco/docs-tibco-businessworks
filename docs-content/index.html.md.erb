This documentation describes the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack provides the runtime component for developers to deploy BusinessWorks (BW) applications to Pivotal Application Service (formerly Elastic Runtime).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition enables you to quickly and easily connect APIs, Microservices, and legacy backend systems. With an easy-to-use drag-and-drop graphical development environment, graphical data mapper, and vast library of connectors, you can quickly and easily create cloud-native integration applications and run them natively on Pivotal Application Service (formerly Elastic Runtime).

When you push a BW application to a PCF deployment, the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack detects the BW application, produces a tarball called a "droplet" that contains a lightweight version of the BW runtime along with the application files, and configures the runtime to run the application when the container starts. For more information about how PCF stages applications, see the [How Applications Are Staged](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/how-applications-are-staged.html#stage-buildpack) topic.

To build applications for the runtime provided by the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack, you must use the TIBCO Business Studio for BusinessWorks development environment. See the [Requirements](index.html#reqs) section below for more information.

The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition runtime simplifies creation of cloud-native integration applications using any of the following integration styles:

* **Batch-oriented**: provides non real-time integration for endpoints such as databases or files, and uses records for data abstraction
* **Process-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as application APIs and adapters, and uses APIs, objects, and messages for data abstraction
* **Service-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as web services and APIs, and uses services and messages for data abstraction
* **Resource-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as mobile or web applications and APIs, and uses resources for data abstraction

TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition runtime natively integrates with Spring Cloud Services for PCF to support Service Registry/Discovery, Configuration Management and Circuit Breaker pattern.
